## Before you open a pull request

Run what CI runs:

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
```

`npm run check` is the same set of steps the workflows run on a pull request,
so a green run locally is a green run there. `npm test` is an alias for it —
this repository has no separate unit-test suite; its ABAP is checked, not
executed.

## What the gates are

| Gate | What it proves |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | abaplint: syntax and style, resolved against the abap2UI5 core |
| `npm run check:cloud` | the same source compiles under ABAP Cloud restrictions |
| `npm run check:abap2ui5` | [abap2UI5-linter](https://github.com/abap2UI5/linter): the app class and the view it builds, judged together — controls, members, bindings, the UI5 version floor, and a headless render of every view |
| `npm run rename` | the namespace rename still applies cleanly |

The abap2UI5-linter keeps a baseline in `abap2ui5lint-baseline.json`. Findings
recorded there are counted and never listed; a **new** finding fails the gate,
and an entry whose finding is gone is stale and fails too. So the file only ever
shrinks — fix something, then refresh it with:

```sh
npx abap2ui5lint --update-baseline
```

## Conventions

English for code, comments, commit messages and pull requests. Commit subjects
are written in the imperative and describe the outcome, not the mechanics. One
topic per pull request. The wider rules the whole ecosystem follows live in
[abap2UI5's CONVENTIONS.md](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5/blob/main/.github/shared/CONVENTIONS.md).

## Views

Views are built with `z2ui5_cl_ui5_view_builder`, the generic builder in the
core's `src/02` — five verbs (`ele`, `tag`, `a`, `end`, `stringify`) that
translate a UI5 XML view one to one. Two things to know before editing a chain:

- `a( )` applies to the element the chain is pointing at, so give a control its
  attributes immediately after the `ele( )` or `tag( )` that opened it;
- an ABAP boolean goes into `b =`, never `v =`. Through `v =` an `abap_false`
  renders as an empty string, which UI5 reads as true.

The frozen `z2ui5_cl_xml_view` is gone from this repository. Do not reintroduce
it: it lives in the core's `src/99`, outside the released API, and the view gate
can read nothing that is built with it.
